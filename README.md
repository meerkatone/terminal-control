# cellshot

Native terminal visual capture for agents, TUI developers, and review workflows.

`cellshot` runs terminal programs at explicit dimensions, interprets their terminal state, and exports reviewable artifacts:

- SVG screenshots with foreground/background styling.
- PNG screenshots derived from SVG.
- JSON styled-frame data for future visual diffs and remote protocols.
- Text snapshots for logs and chat output.
- Raw ANSI/VT streams for replay through alternate terminal backends.

PNG artifacts render at 2x pixel density by default for sharp HiDPI viewing. SVG artifacts remain resolution-independent.

This is the first vertical slice of a larger goal: a small native replacement for terminal automation tools that can launch, drive, capture, diff, and remotely inspect interactive terminal applications.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.93 or newer.

The first working backend uses the pure-Rust `vt100` parser to keep installation small and dependable. A Ghostty VT adapter is planned for advanced protocol fidelity; the current published Rust binding was evaluated but its vendored Zig build is not yet dependable on this macOS toolchain.

## Install

Install from the private GitHub repository on a machine whose SSH key can access it:

```bash
cargo install --locked --git ssh://git@github.com/kitlangton/cellshot.git cellshot
cellshot --help
```

Update an existing installation after pulling a newer release:

```bash
cargo install --locked --force --git ssh://git@github.com/kitlangton/cellshot.git cellshot
```

The repository is a binary crate: the installed product is the `cellshot` executable. No application embedding API is promised yet.

## Usage

Capture a real PTY command after its screen output becomes idle:

```bash
cellshot capture --cols 90 --rows 28 --out captures/colors -- \
  sh -lc 'printf "\033[48;2;30;34;42m\033[38;2;196;215;240m  cellshot  \033[0m\n\033[31merror\033[0m and \033[32msuccess\033[0m\n"'
```

Use `--pixel-ratio 1` when a smaller PNG is preferable, or `--pixel-ratio 3` for extra-large review assets.

Capture a long-running terminal UI after an idle checkpoint or deadline:

```bash
cellshot capture --cols 100 --rows 32 --settle-ms 500 --deadline-ms 4000 \
  --out captures/app -- my-terminal-app
```

Drive a menu open after the application's initial render, then capture the resulting state:

```bash
cellshot capture --cols 100 --rows 32 -s ctrl-p text:model enter \
  --out captures/command-menu -- my-terminal-app
```

Applications with startup logs can be gated until the intended UI has mounted:

```bash
cellshot capture --initial-delay-ms 1500 --wait-for "Commands" \
  -s ctrl-p --out captures/menu -- my-terminal-app
```

Render raw ANSI/VT bytes from stdin:

```bash
printf '\033[44;97m terminal output \033[0m\n' | cellshot ansi --out captures/stdin
```

Each command produces:

```text
captures/colors.svg
captures/colors.png
captures/colors.json
captures/colors.txt
captures/colors.ansi
```

## Agent Quick Reference

An agent driving a TUI should use this sequence:

1. Run `cellshot capture --cols <width> --rows <height> --out <stem> -- <command> [args...]` for a static initial screen.
2. Add `--wait-for '<visible text>'` before `-s` / `--send` when opening a dialog or selecting a view. A missing readiness checkpoint is an error, not a screenshot.
3. Add ordered input after one `-s` flag: key values are `ctrl-p`, `enter`, `escape`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, and `tab`; typed input is `text:<value>`. Example: `-s ctrl-p text:model enter`. Quote events containing spaces, such as `-s ctrl-p 'text:dark mode' enter`.
4. Read `<stem>.txt` to confirm visible labels and `<stem>.json` for structured cells; open `<stem>.png` for visual review. Keep `<stem>.ansi` when diagnosing parsing or host-handshake behavior.
5. Increase `--deadline-ms` when startup is slow, increase `--settle-ms` for animations, and use `--pixel-ratio 1` only when a smaller PNG matters more than sharp review output.

`capture` writes SVG and PNG visual output plus JSON, text, and raw ANSI artifacts. Use `--no-png` or `--no-svg` only to skip the corresponding visual file. `ansi` performs the same export from a recorded terminal stream or stdin without launching a process.

### Example Agent Calls

Capture the initial app view and inspect it as text before requesting visual review:

```bash
cellshot capture --cols 110 --rows 36 --out /tmp/app-home -- my-terminal-app
cat /tmp/app-home.txt
```

Open a command palette, type a search, accept it, and capture the resulting view in one process launch:

```bash
cellshot capture --cols 110 --rows 36 --deadline-ms 8000 \
  --wait-for "Commands" \
  -s ctrl-p text:theme enter \
  --out /tmp/app-theme -- my-terminal-app
```

Capture a real OpenCode dialog once its welcome screen exposes the `/connect` command hint:

```bash
cellshot capture --cols 112 --rows 34 --deadline-ms 10000 \
  --host opentui --wait-for "/connect" -s text:/connect enter \
  --out /tmp/opencode-connect -- opencode
```

This is efficient for one target state: one PTY launch produces all artifact types and an ordered input burst avoids relaunching solely for `type -> enter` flows. `--send` remains repeatable when constructing commands programmatically, while `-s ctrl-p text:model enter` is the concise human/agent form. It is not yet efficient for a gallery of several states in the same session; a future session API will keep one TUI alive while taking multiple snapshots.

Use `--host opentui` for OpenTUI programs such as OpenCode that request terminal capability responses during startup. Leave it unset for ordinary terminal programs; the generic capture path does not impersonate a richer terminal host.

## Current Scope

Implemented now:

- PTY command launch at explicit terminal dimensions.
- Idle/deadline snapshot capture for running applications.
- Ordered post-readiness input for driving menus and forms (`-s` / `--send`).
- Initial delay and visible-text gates for applications that log before mounting a TUI.
- Input checkpoints: with `--wait-for` plus queued keys/text, interaction begins as soon as the target content appears rather than waiting on continuously animated screens to become idle.
- An opt-in OpenTUI startup handshake response (`--host opentui`) so applications waiting on terminal capabilities can render under capture without changing generic PTY behavior.
- Screen freezing before process teardown, preserving alternate-screen TUI frames in exported artifacts.
- Bounded raw-stream retention (`--max-bytes`, default 16 MiB) and bounded teardown for captured PTY processes.
- ANSI/stdin rendering without process launch.
- Raw VT stream retention for debugging and backend replay.
- Styled visible frame extraction from the initial pure-Rust VT backend.
- SVG, PNG, JSON, text, and ANSI artifact output.
- HiDPI PNG export (`--pixel-ratio`, default `2`).

## OpenCode Proof Capture

The MVP has been used to run a real OpenCode TUI, answer its OpenTUI terminal startup handshake, open dialogs by sending keyboard events, and capture PNG artifacts:

```text
captures/opencode-home-vector-hidpi.png
captures/opencode-command-palette-vector-hidpi.png
captures/opencode-provider-dialog-vector-hidpi.png
```

The host-handshake logic is currently intentionally narrow: it identifies the OpenTUI startup query sequence and returns a dark-theme capability response sufficient for visual capture. It should become a general terminal-host implementation before this tool is published as a universal automation replacement.

Next layers:

- Persistent named sessions and a local daemon.
- `type`, `press`, `click`, `resize`, `wait`, and `wait-idle` controls.
- Timestamped input/output recording and deterministic replay into screenshot sequences, animated images, or encoded video.
- HTML galleries and cell-level visual diffs.
- Native attach UI.
- Authenticated remote/SSH-forwarded control.
- Ghostty VT adapter, bundled deterministic fonts, and richer glyph/protocol rendering.

## Design

The central design choice is to preserve terminal state as structured visual data rather than only retaining ANSI bytes or pixels:

```text
PTY or ANSI bytes
  -> terminal backend state (`vt100` now, Ghostty adapter planned)
  -> cellshot styled frame JSON
  -> SVG / PNG / text / future diffs and galleries
```

This lets terminal screenshots become inspectable and diffable review artifacts rather than opaque image captures.
