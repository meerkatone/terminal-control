## Glossary

### Shot

One exported visible terminal frame and any selected artifact formats derived from it. A shot can observe a launched command, piped command output, an ANSI/VT stream, or a live session.

### Frame

The versioned structured visible terminal state underlying a shot. A frame contains geometry, styled cells, and optional cursor state and can be serialized as JSON for external tooling.

### Session

A named terminal application that remains available across waiting, input, resizing, history inspection, and shots. A session is `running` while accepting input, or `exited` when its application has ended but its final shot remains inspectable until explicitly stopped. A session retains bounded normal-screen scrollback for log-oriented history inspection and the most recent bounded ANSI/VT transcript bytes; alternate-screen TUIs are observed as shots rather than scrollback. A session may write a recording timeline while it runs, including viewport resize events.

An embedded session owns the same live terminal lifecycle in-process; the named CLI session commands are an adapter for interacting with that lifecycle across invocations.

### Driver

A versioned JSON Lines stdin/stdout adapter over embedded sessions for external agent tooling and the experimental TypeScript test client. A driver process can manage multiple isolated sessions without exposing terminal process details to its client. Its shot response includes the reason capture completed so test clients can distinguish settled screen state from deadline fallback, and can optionally include ANSI or rendered SVG failure evidence.

### Recording

A timestamped terminal event timeline containing output, client or automatic host input, and viewport resize events. A recording can be rendered to video and should be treated as potentially sensitive.

### ANSI/VT Stream

Raw terminal output bytes containing text and terminal control sequences. Files commonly use an `.ansi` suffix, but the suffix does not imply a separate container format.
